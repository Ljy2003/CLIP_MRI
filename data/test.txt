data/image/pacc1.png	singleton pregnancy, fetal biparietal diameter about 75 mm. widening of the cerebral longitudinal fissure pools, corpus callosum knee vaguely visible, body and pressure not shown, left ventricle width about 10.9 mm, right ventricle width about 10.1 mm, third and fourth ventricles are not dilated, bilaterals fissure morphology is acceptable, brain parenchyma signals do not show any obvious abnormality, and the midline structure is centered. The cerebellar peduncle was present. The posterior cranial fossa pool did not show obvious abnormality. The transverse diameter of the cerebellum was about 3.37 cm, and the morphology and signal of the cerebellum and brainstem did not show any abnormality. 
data/image/pacc2.png	A singleton pregnancy with a biparietal diameter of approximately 7.36 cm. The gray and white matter of the brain is well demarcated and the sulcal gyrus is well developed. The corpus callosum was visible at the knee, and the periphery of the corpus callosum was visible as a strip of abnormal signal, with low signal on T2WI. The body of corpus callosum and the pressure part of corpus callosum were not clearly shown, and the bilateral ventricles were separated; the remaining ventricles and cerebral pools did not show obvious abnormalities in size and location. The size and shape of the cerebellar peduncle was acceptable. The posterior cranial fossa pool did not show abnormal widening. The transverse diameter of the cerebellum was 3.2 cm, and the morphology and signal of the cerebellum and brainstem did not show any abnormality. 
data/image/pacc3.png	singleton pregnancy, fetal biparietal diameter about 6.55cm, cerebral gray-white matter is clearly demarcated, cortical sulcus can be developed. In the midline of the brain, there was a blocky T2 low-signal T1 slightly high-signal foci of about 0.7Ã—2.3 cm, and the corpus callosum did not show clearly; the morphology, size and location of the ventricles and the cerebral pools did not show any obvious abnormality. The cerebellum was present, with a transverse cerebellar diameter of about 2.83 cm, and the posterior cranial fossa pool was not significantly widened. The morphology and signal of the cerebellum and brainstem did not show any obvious abnormality. 
data/image/pacc6.png	Single pregnancy, cephalic position. The gray and white matter of the fetal brain is well demarcated. Bilateral ventricles are separated, part of the corpus Subscribe to DeepL Pro to edit this document.

The longitudinal fissure pool is locally widened. The left ventricle was about 19.9 mm wide and the right ventricle was about 9.7 mm wide. the third and fourth ventricles were not widened. The cerebral parenchyma signal showed no obvious abnormality; the occipital pool of the posterior cranial fossa was widened, with a width of about 1.2 cm. the transverse diameter of the cerebellum was about 33.8 mm, and the high diameter of the earth's part was about 12.6 mm. no abnormality was seen in the morphology and signal of the cerebellum and brain stem. There was no widening of the sulcus, and the midline structure was centered. The cranial signal showed no obvious abnormality. 
data/image/dcc4.png	singleton pregnancy, fetal biparietal diameter of about 6.65 cm. cerebral gray-white matter was clearly demarcated, brain parenchyma signal did not show obvious abnormality, bilateral lateral fissure and part of the cerebral sulcus could be seen to be formed, the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle was about 1.0 cm wide, and the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle was about 0.64 cm wide, the pool of the longitudinal fissure was slightly widened, and the radial sign appeared to be seen in the mid-sagittal position. The corpus callosum is visible, thin, with a centered midline structure. The cerebellar vermis is present. The posterior cranial fossa pool is not significantly widened. The transverse diameter of the cerebellum was about 2.91 cm, and the height of the cerebellar peduncle was about 1.36 cm. The morphology and signal of the cerebellum and the brainstem did not show any abnormality. The fetal cord was seen to be wrapped around the neck for one week.
